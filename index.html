            <p>Welcome to this Machine Learning tutorial! In this tutorial, we will cover the basics of machine learning, including key concepts, algorithms, and practical applications. Whether you are a beginner or looking to enhance your skills, this tutorial will provide you with a solid foundation in machine learning.</p>
            <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
            <p>Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. It involves training models on datasets to identify patterns and make informed decisions without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks.</p>
            <!-- <h2>Types of Machine Learning</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> In supervised learning, the model is trained on labeled data, where the input data is paired with the corresponding output labels. The model learns to make predictions based on this training data.</li>
                <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> In unsupervised learning, the model is trained on unlabeled data, where the goal is to identify patterns or structures within the data without predefined labels.</li>
                <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> In reinforcement learning, the model learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Common Machine Learning Algorithms</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Linear Regression:</strong> A simple algorithm used for predicting continuous values based on input features.</li>
                <li><strong>Decision Trees:</strong> A tree-based algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>Support Vector Machines (SVM):</strong> A powerful algorithm used for classification tasks by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates different classes.</li>
                <li><strong>Neural Networks:</strong> A complex algorithm inspired by the human brain, used for deep learning tasks such as image and speech recognition.</li>
